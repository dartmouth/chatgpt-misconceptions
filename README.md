# chatgpt-misconceptions
Large Language Models are an incredibly powerful foundational technology that is continuing to enable many new applications and infuse existing tools to add new and amazing features. But with all the excitement around them, the flood of new applications can be overwhelming and many details are lost in the noise.

In this session, we will equip you with some important foundational knowledge on how Large Language Models work, what they can and cannot do, and how most of the new AI applications you hear about are actually variations on a small handful of themes. With the information from this workshop, you will be able to navigate the AI landscape more confidently, spot the mechanisms underpinning many LLM-based applications, and critically assess emerging tools and their claims and promises.

Everyone who is curious about LLMs and AI is welcome, no prior knowledge required.



## Getting started

### Requirements

This workshop has no special requirements. You can run many demos in [Dartmouth Chat](https://chat.dartmouth.edu). For the demos presented in Jupyter notebook form, please install the requirements using the following command:
